-  This code is a RESTful API for an e-commerce application. It allows you to manage users, items, and carts using standard HTTP methods. You can create, retrieve, update, and delete users, items, and carts. The API follows RESTful principles, providing a structured and standardized way to interact with the resources.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Challenges

-   When creating or editing names of certain files, there are errors that you can't easily undo. In such cases, it is often best to delete those files and start anew.
-   I had to perform a hard reset on my project twice due to issues with GitHub. I made a big mistake when attempting to dry test cloning, and I learned the importance of always changing the directory before cloning.
-   It's easy to get tunnel vision and focus solely on one problem at a time, which can occasionally yield positive results. However, most of the time, it delays progress on the entire project.
-   Don't get too ahead of yourself. Use the time you save to learn more, understand more, or theoretically test certain aspects of things.

## note to self

-   should have done this in the begining but never lates than never?
-   july 1 going instead of having to manually putting in the userid i need to have the user to create a new cart -done july 1
