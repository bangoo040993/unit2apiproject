### Challenges

- When creating or editing names of certain files, there are errors that you can't easily undo. In such cases, it is often best to delete those files and start anew. 
- I had to perform a hard reset on my project twice due to issues with GitHub. I made a big mistake when attempting to dry test cloning, and I learned the importance of always changing the directory before cloning. 
- It's easy to get tunnel vision and focus solely on one problem at a time, which can occasionally yield positive results. However, most of the time, it delays progress on the entire project.
- Don't get too ahead of yourself. Use the time you save to learn more, understand more, or theoretically test certain aspects of things.
